chmod - command to modify access rights on files and directories


umask 
The umask is a three-digit value that refers to read/write/execute permissions for owner, group, and public. Its purpose
is to set default permissions on new files and directories created without touching the existing files and directories. In
RHEL, the default umask value is set to 0022 for the root and other system users and 0002 for all regular users with
bash shell assigned. Note that the left-most 0 has no significance

umask - display current umask value

The pre-defined initial permission values are 666 (rw-rw-rw-) for files and 777 (rwxrwxrwx) for directories. Even if
the umask is set to 000, the new files will always get a maximum of 666 permissions, and we use the chmod command
to add executable bits explicitly if desired.
