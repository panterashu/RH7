The Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide an extended group of permissions that may be set on files and directories.

The ACLs allow us to define permissions for specific users and groups using either the octal or symbolic notation of permission
allocation. The specific users may or may not be part of the same group. ACLs are configured and treated the same
way on both files and directories. Before any ACLs are applied to a file or directory, the file system it is located in has to
be mounted or remounted with ACL support enabled. This support is turned on for XFS file systems by default;
however, it needs to be activated for extended file systems. ACLs can also be used on both NFS and CIFS file systems.

ACLs are categorized into two groups based on their types, and are referred to as access ACLs and default ACLs.
Access ACLs are set on individual files and directories whereas default ACLs can only be applied at the directory level.
Files and sub-directories under a parent directory with default ACLs set inherit the default ACL settings.
